Neopixel Infinity Mirror using ESP32c3 for high school electronics, engineering, or computer science courses. Features a small 3D printed case, PCB to solder, and uses Adafruit's Neopixel library for control.

Feb 20th Purdue ETTE PD

If you're here for the PD, welcome! We will take care of installing and setting up arduino first thing. If you can, install the Arduino IDE by going to this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

Once installed, we will add a board manager for the microcontroller we will use.  You will need to copy the link below into the Arduino IDE in the Preferences section: 

https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json

From there, we will add the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" in our boards manager, by searching for "esp32".

Then, we will add the Adafruit Neopixel Library from the library manager.
