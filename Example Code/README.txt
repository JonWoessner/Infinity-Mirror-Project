> Infinity Mirror PIO: started a project in platform IO
> basic_examples: This is a more finished example.  I used the accelerometer in this one, as well as both self-developed functions and the ones Adafruit has in the "strandtest" file.

> simple_strandtest: This file is bare-bones starting space, used for the first neopixel examples. It has only the setup code for the strip in place, and students will code along with me as we go over the neopixel functions in the library.
